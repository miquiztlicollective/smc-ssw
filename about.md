## What is a Student Sustainability Workshop?

The Student Sustainability Workshop is a unique, peer-to-peer educational program where students learn about important environmental issues and the ways that they can incorporate sustainable practices into their everyday lives, improve their quality of life, and save resources while saving money. Student also learn about careers in the emerging green economy and the paths they can take to pursue them.

Each Workshop is made up of a group of 15 â€“ 25 students who meet once a week for 8 weeks. The Workshops are structured around the exploration of the issues and solutions related to 6 key topics: water, energy, waste, chemicals, transportation and shopping/food. Guided by the Workshop Leader and the program text, the Sustainable Worksbook, students learn about the local, regional, and global environmental impact of their daily choices and the solutions they can use to reduce that impact. In addition to the weekly Workshop meetings, students are given the opportunity to apply what they are learning about environmental stewardship by participating in a 3-hour community service project with a local non-profit or on-campus organization.
